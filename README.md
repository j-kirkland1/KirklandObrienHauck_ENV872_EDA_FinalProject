METADATA: The metadata for this project was adapted from the metadata provided by NOAA Diver generated upon downloading of the dataset. 

# **Title**: NOAA DIVER Penobscot Mercury Dataset

## **Summary**

This dataset contains Mercury results from sediment samples collected in the Penobscot River region in Maine. The dataset originates from NOAA’s DIVER (Data Integration, Visualization, Exploration and Reporting) system, which is part of the NOAA Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program (DARRP).

## **Data Content Information**

The data reveals Mercury concentrations within sediment samples from the Penobscot River from June 1st, 1970 to May 5th, 2021. This dataset includes environmental contamination data collected from field observations, samples, lab test results, and photographs. The data is standardized and integrated into the DIVER data warehouse and can be accessed through the DIVER Explorer query tool or the NOAA Environmental Research Division’ Data Access Program (ERDDAP) data service. The purpose of the NOAA Damage Assessment, Remediation, and Restoration Program is to gather data to support the protection and restoration of natural resources on behalf of the public. The DARRP Program helps to assist with remediation from oil spills, releases of hazardous waste, and other sources of environmental contamination.

## **Naming attribute definitions - definitions acquired from metadata provided by NOAA Diver**

**Case_Activity**: The name of the case incident or the activity used to collect data.  

**Site_ID**: Identifier for a site in the database.  

**Study_Name**: The name of the study under which the field data were collected.  

**Area_Description**: General description or name of the area sampled (e.g., a particular reef or marsh).  

**Matrix_Group**: Identifier for location of results in the database structure - sediment, water, oil, tissue.  

**Station**: Station or site identifier. This is often defined by the workplan and/or recorded by the field team, but may be standardized to database requirements.  

**Date**: Data collection date, as year, month, and day.  

**Sample_ID**: Unique ID assigned to each sample by the field sampler.  

**Sample_Upper_Depth**: The upper depth of a sediment, soil, water, oil, or tar sample.  

**Sample_Lower_Depth**: The lower depth of a sediment, soil, water, oil, or tar sample.  

**Sample_Depth_Unit**: The unit of the depth measurement.  

**Depth_Category**: This applies to sediment samples, and classifies them as surface sediment (upper depth of 0 cm and lower depth less than 30 cm) or subsurface sediment.  

**Lab_Replicate**: Replicate number if the laboratory analyzed the same sample multiple times by the same method (lab duplicates, typically indicated by 1,2,3) or by different methods for the same analyte (less preferred method will generally have an X).  

**ChemCode**: Abbreviation used to represent Analysis. See Chemical Dictionary for key.  

**Max_Result_.Raw.**: Concentration of Mercury in PPM.  

**Analysis_Result_Unit**: Unit of the Analysis Result. 

**Start_Latitude**: Data latitude.  

**Start_Longitude**: Data longitude.  


## **Access and Use Constraints - obtained from metadata provided by NOAA Diver**

**Access Constraints**: The data may be provisional and restricted to Trustees within a Natural Resource Damage Assessment.

**Use Constraints**: The user is responsible for the results of any application of this data for other than its intended purpose. NOAA attempts to ensure the complete accuracy of their data, but do not guarantee that there will be no errors. NOAA requests to be notified should errors be encountered, and they will work to correct them immediately.
